## The scripts are cloned from the original aui scripts from Helmuthdu, which ar not being maintained anymore.
I find them handy. The dotfiles and the sharedfunc need to be in the same dir as the ais, aui and aui_automode.

First run `./ais`, then `./aui`, it will ask for enabling `aui_automode`. Previously you can check aui_automode for possible packages and setup options.
If running `./aui` without `aui_automode`, you can choose every option manually.
